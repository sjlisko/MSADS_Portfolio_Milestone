Description:
The Coronavirus Pandemic has created many challenges for businesses and governments. The federal government created many programs under the CARES act to help businesses pay their expenses so that they may be able to come out on the other side of this pandemic instead of having to close their doors. One such program was the Paycheck Protection Program. This analysis will look into the types of business, the amount of the loans, and how many employees they were able to retain because of this program. 

Research Questions:

   •	What Business Congressional Districts gave out the most loans?

   •	How many businesses were in each loan range? 

   •	What is the percentage of the types of business to receive the loans?
